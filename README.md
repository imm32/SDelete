## Introduction

SDelete (Secure Delete) is a command-line utility from Microsoft Sysinternals designed to securely erase files and clean free disk space on Windows systems. Unlike standard file deletion, which merely marks data as deleted and leaves it recoverable, SDelete overwrites file contents, making recovery virtually impossible. This ensures sensitive information, such as confidential documents or temporary files, is permanently removed.

SDelete supports a variety of use cases, including the deletion of individual files and folders, wiping free space to prevent recovery of previously deleted data, and working with both NTFS and FAT file systems. It can overwrite data with multiple passes, providing configurable levels of security, and adheres to recognized standards for secure deletion, including the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD 5220.22-M) guidelines.

For system administrators, SDelete is a practical tool for managing data security across workstations and servers. It can be integrated into scripts and automated processes, allowing consistent, reliable, and secure data cleanup. Operating entirely via command-line, SDelete is lightweight, flexible, and effective, making it an essential solution for organizations and individuals seeking to protect sensitive data and reduce the risk of information recovery.
